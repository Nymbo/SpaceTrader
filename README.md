# SpaceTrader
Repository for my game SpaceTrader written in python.

## Requirements

The game requires Python 3 installed on your PC with addition of the PyGame library.
After you installed use the command line, go to the game directory and run `python main.py`

## Game overview

The game SpaceTrader is a game where you become a trader in control of a spaceship - a carrier. You buy and sell cargos on 8 different
planets and make profits by buying on planets which support cargo and selling on planets consuming cargo.


## Controls and gameplay

The game consists of two modes - fly mode and in dock mode. In the flying mode you are in control of the carrier ship - use arrows keys
to turn and accelerate/decelerate. Also in fly mode you can press the TAB key to see the resources you are carrying. When you reach
a planet and fly over it's dock you will be able to enter the dock, in order to do so press the D key.
You can also check what is available at each planet and at what price by hovering a mouse over the 
navigation guides of each planet. 
In dock mode you can sell or buy a resource - use the mouse to click either red down arrow to buy a resource or the green up arrow to sell.
After you done selling/buying press D again to leave the dock.

## Spaceships

When you've earned enough credits you can buy a larger spaceship. Next to the earth
there is a shipyard, where you can buy/sell spaceships and embark them. To enter
a shipyard stop on the landing area and press enter to enable shipyard mode.
You will see three panels for each available ship. At the beginning of a game
you only own a small spaceship. To buy a different one, press the red arrow in it's panel.
You can embark an owned ship by moving the mouse over the rotating ship image and clicking
the "Embark" button, which will appear. Of course, you can only embark an owned ship.
